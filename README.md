BibTeX files are typically manually maintained and thus often contain
inconsistences, mistakes, or are missing information. BetterBib helps
maintaining your BibTeX files by comparing them with online sources and
correctiing whatever entries were found faulty. For example, the BibTeX entry
```
@article {krylov,
  author = {Liesen and Strako≈°},
  title = {Krylov subspace methods}
}
```
is converted into
```
@book{krylov,
    AUTHOR = {Liesen, J{\"o}rg and Strako{\v{s}}, Zden{\v{e}}k},
     TITLE = {Krylov subspace methods},
    SERIES = {Numerical Mathematics and Scientific Computation},
      NOTE = {Principles and analysis},
 PUBLISHER = {Oxford University Press, Oxford},
      YEAR = {2013},
     PAGES = {xvi+391},
      ISBN = {978-0-19-965541-0},
   MRCLASS = {65F10 (65F15)},
  MRNUMBER = {3024841},
MRREVIEWER = {Melina A. Freitag},
}
```
by simply calling
```
betterbib in.bib out.bib
```

At the moment, the only BetterBib backend is the
[MathSciNet](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/) service, so you'll have to be in a
university network for it to work.
